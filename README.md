### Hi there 👋
My name is Caitlin and I'm a senior engineer from the UK. I'm currently looking for Rust or Functional programming jobs in the UK so if you have an opening feel free to see my website https://cat.bio/ for my CV or just contact me directly at cat@cat.bio 👍

A few of my specialities are:
* Rust, C++, C#, Haskell (but I'm known for being able to use just about any language :P)
* High performance applications such as 3d graphics, GIS and data processing
* Docker and microservices architectures

I'm also a game developer in my spare time, (and anything else I think of! check out my repositories page 😉), and love figuring out how to build new things.

I have a github organization I use to (somewhat unsuccessfully) stop my repositories list from getting out of control: https://github.com/catchouli-old

See https://cat.bio/ for my full profile 👍
